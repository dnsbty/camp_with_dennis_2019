      A nation as great as ours deserves an amazing birthday party.
      For the last 4 years, Americamping has been celebrating Murica and its natural splendor.
      This year we will pitch our tents at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FdgjUBG7TX4xz1rD7">Payson Lakes Campground</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Hidden among the pines between McClellan Lake, Box Lake, and the Big East Reservoir, the site is only a 50 minute drive from the Provo-Orem metropolitan area.
      Come join us for fun friends, great games, fantastic food, and maybe even cool canoeing on a little lake (BYOC).

    <p class="mb-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
      This year I've decided to do away with the invite-only requirement.
      Invite your friends.
      Invite your mom.
      It's going to be a great time for everyone.
      The only thing to keep in mind is the campsite only has room for 60 people.
      Register ASAP to make sure there is a spot for you.
